--------------------
version 1.6.4
-----
* Fixed little bug in function ``ffRanefLMER.fnc''.
* Added argument ``if.warn.not.add'' to functions ``ffRanefLMER.fnc'' and 
``fitLMER.fnc''.
* Added arguments ``plot.dat'' and ``path'' to function 
``plotLMER3d.fnc''.
* Added arguments ``add'', ``alpha'', and ``xy'' to function
``plotRaw3d.fnc''. 
* In function ``plotLMER3d.fnc'', can now plot even if error message
``Error in persp3d.default(x = as.numeric(rownames(z)), 
y = as.numeric(colnames(z)),  : increasing 'x' and 'y' values expected''
occurs. Issues the following warning: ``plotting anyways, but will not
use supplied x- and y-values ...''.
* Added model ``z'' to run a new example in function 
``plotRaw3d.fnc''.
* Added function ``mcposthoc.fnc''.
--------------------
version 1.6.3
-----
* In function ``plotLMER3d.fnc'', added the possibility to 
add a tittle to "persp" plots, in addition to
* the option of having a flat miror image underneath the main 3d 
surface of "persp3d" plots,
* rug plots for the three types of plots and for the flat
miror image underneath the main 3d surface of "persp3d" plots,
* transparency control for the main 3d surface, reference level, 
and flat miror image for "persp3d" plots, and
* the option to return the z and color matrices used for 
plotting.
* Added function ``plotDensity3d.fnc''.
* Added function ``plotRaw3d.fnc''.
* Added data ``erpFz''.
--------------------
version 1.6.2
-----
* Added argument ``data'' to function ``posthoc.fnc''.
* Added argument ``prior.releveling'' to function ``posthoc.fnc''.
--------------------
version 1.6
-----
* Added function ``plotLMER3d.fnc'' to create (dyanmic) 3d
plots of models fitted with LMER.
* Added sub-argument ``corr'' to argument ``ran.effects'' in 
functions ``ffRanefLMER.fnc'' and ``fitLMER.fnc''.
* In function ``ffRanefLMER.fnc'', when ``ran.effects'' is a vector
(e.g., c("(Condition | Subject)", "(0 + TrialNum | Subject)")), the 
function now checks whether variables specified in ``ran.effects'' 
are present in the fixed-effects structure. If the variable appearing 
in a ranef is not present in model coefficients, it is skipped.
* Fixed a little bug in function ``ffRanefLMER.fnc'' regarding
the testing of random effects of the form ``(Condition|Subject)''.
* Fixed a little bug in functions ``bfFixefLMER_F.fnc'' and 
``bfFixefLMER_t.fnc'': When all model terms are removed, the 
functions now return a model with only an intercept and whatever 
random effects were in the model.
* Added argument ``prune.ranefs'' to functions ``bfFixefLMER_F.fnc'',
``bfFixefLMER_t.fnc'', and ``fitLMER.fnc''.
--------------------
version 1.5.3
-----
* Function ``pamer.fnc'' now accepts models with interactions
in the ranef structure (e.g., (1|X:Y).
* Added lower- and upper-bound degrees of freedom to ``posthoc.fnc''
results, as well as lower- and upper-bound unadjusted p-values
and lower- and upper-bound adjusted p-values (Bonferroni corrected).
* fixed a bug in function ``fitLMER.fnc'': the function does not set
the current working directory to ``tempdir()'' anymore and then leave 
you there once the fitting is done.
--------------------
version 1.5.2
-----
* In function ``fitLMER.fnc'', changed argument ``file.name'' to 
``log.file.name'' to make it more transparent.
* Disabled the automatic changing of the current working directory
to directory ``temp.dir'' in functions ``bfFixefLMER_F.fnc'', 
``bfFixefLMER_t.fnc'', ``ffRanefLMER.fnc'', and ``fitLMER.fnc''.
* Argumants ``model'' and ``data'' now have no default value in
functions ``bfFixefLMER_F.fnc'', ``bfFixefLMER_t.fnc'', 
``ffRanefLMER.fnc'', and ``fitLMER.fnc'' (before version 1.5.2,
these arguments had ``as.character()'' as a default).
* Column ``expl.dev.'' in function ``pamer.fnc'' now lists the 
percentage explained (which is simply the value returned in version
1.5 times 100). 

--------------------
version 1.5
-----
* Function ``pamer.fnc'' additioanlly returns the deviance explained, 
R-squared, for each model term.
* Fixed a little bug with the fitting logs. The user can now change the
path to where the log will be saved.
* Added argument ``col = "red"'' to function ``mcp.fnc''.

--------------------
version 1.4
-----
* Removed dependency on package ``Design'', and consequently removed 
any example that uses ``rcs'' or ``poly''.

--------------------
version 1.3
-----
* Added argument ``trim'' to functions ``mcp.fnc'' and ``romr.fnc'';

* Removed argument ``data'' in function ``mcp.fnc''. The data frame 
on which the model was fitted is now automatically retrieved from the
model object itself (``model@frame'').

* Added values ``Upper Den. Df'', ``Lower Den. DF'', and ``Lower p value'' 
to function ``pamer.fnc''.

* Added argument ``llrt'' (log-likelihood ratio testing) to functions 
``bfFixefLMER_F.fnc'', ``bfFixefLMER.fnc_t'', and ``fitLMER.fnc''.

* Added argument ``p.value'' to functions ``fitLMER.fnc'' and 
``bfFixefLMER_F.fnc'' to allow the user to choose to backfit either 
on upper-bound (anti-conservative) or lower-bound (consevative) 
\emph{p''-values.

* Added function ``posthoc.fnc''.

* Added function ``perSubjectTrim.fnc''.
