--------------------
version 1.4
-----
* Removed dependency on package ``Design'', and consequently removed any example that uses ``rcs'' or ``poly''.

--------------------
version 1.3
-----
* Added argument ``trim'' to functions ``mcp.fnc'' and ``romr.fnc'';

* Removed argument ``data'' in function ``mcp.fnc''. The data frame on which the model was fitted is now automatically retrieved from the model object itself (``model@frame'').

* Added values ``Upper Den. Df'', ``Lower Den. DF'', and ``Lower p value'' to function ``pamer.fnc''.

* Added argument ``llrt'' (log-likelihood ratio testing) to functions ``bfFixefLMER_F.fnc'', ``bfFixefLMER.fnc_t'', and ``fitLMER.fnc''.

* Added argument ``p.value'' to functions ``fitLMER.fnc'' and ``bfFixefLMER_F.fnc'' to allow the user to choose to backfit either on upper-bound (anti-conservative) or lower-bound (consevative) \emph{p''-values.

* Added function ``posthoc.fnc''.

* Added function ``perSubjectTrim.fnc''.
